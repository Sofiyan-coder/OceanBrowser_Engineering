    <h1>Dinosaur</h1>
    <p>Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles[note 1] of the clade Dinosauria. <br>
         They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago (mya), <br>although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is a subject of active research. <br>
         They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 mya and their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. <br>
         The fossil record shows that birds are feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch,<br>
         and are the only dinosaur lineage known to have survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 mya. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs—birds—and the extinct non-avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds.</p>
