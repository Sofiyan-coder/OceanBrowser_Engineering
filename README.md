# Ocean Browser
## My Simple Python Browser

This project is a basic implementation of a web browser using Python, designed to demonstrate how browsers work under the hood. The browser can perform the following key functions:

- **URL Parsing**: Breaks down a URL into its components (scheme, host, path) to understand how to access the web page.
- **DNS Resolution**: Converts hostnames into IP addresses using DNS lookups.
- **HTTP Requests**: Sends HTTP requests to web servers using the GET method, specifying the path and version of HTTP (e.g., HTTP/1.0).
- **Rendering Responses**: Processes and displays the server's HTTP response, including HTML content.
- **Network Communication**: Uses sockets to establish connections with servers over specified ports.
- **Command-Line Interaction**: Interacts with the browser through a simple command-line interface, allowing users to input URLs and view web pages.

This project is intended as a learning tool and is not a full-fledged browser. It focuses on the core concepts of web communication and HTTPS.
